# Predicting Death Due to Heart Problems through Machine Learning
- Explored and modified the data to build 'recipes', allowing the different models easily capture the data
- Set up different models to train by tuning the parameters
- Explored different models to reach a high accuracy and low false-positive, leading to the best performing models

# Tables of Contents
- **Introduction:** Brief introduction to the dataset with a description of each columns
- **Overview of the Dataset:** Contains Exploratory Data Analysis prior to further understand the data, helping the process prior to creating the model
- **Setting Up the Model:** Includes the process of splitting the data, applying the model onto the modified dataset, and setting up the workflow
- **Hyper-Parameters Tuning:** Tuning the parameters of each model that would achieve the highest AUC and accuracy
- **Testing the Model:** Test the model using the split dataset with the chosen model
- **Conclusion:** Brief statement about the overall results of the project
- **References:** Includes all references that is heavily put into the Exploratory Data Analysis section

# Opening the Project

Please open the "Final-Project_Daniel.html" file to see further details of the project \\
The codes are mostly listed in the rmarkdown file: "Final Project_Daniel.Rmd" \\
To save time upon running the code, please download the "tuned models" file to get the saved tuning
